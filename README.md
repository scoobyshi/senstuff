# senstuff
This was a crude Node app setup to sense motion near the door, and greet visitors to the door with an R2-D2 twiddle, and some Cantina music
for our Star Wars party.  I'd like to genericize this to use for other purposes, since the trickiest part was tuning this particular PiR sensor 
the way I needed it to behave.
